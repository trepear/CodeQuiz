CODE QUIZ!

https://trepear.github.io/CodeQuiz/

Our goal is to create a quiz with a start page, multiple questions (all being monitored by a timer), and then a high score page at the end where one can insert their initials and store their answers

Still To-Do:
    - Add timer to quizStar()
    - The entirety of checkAnswer()
    - The entirety of lastQuestion()
    - The entirety of highscores.html
